i just am a useless failure, i cant do anything good in my life, ive been shown that people care about me, then turned around and stabbed me in the back. reversing everything i hoped, i was shown exactly how much i am unloved. it has shown me how much i am just a failure. at this point in my life i just want to go hang myself,i cant deal with this suffering any longer, i thought i was loved and cared for. but ive only been stabbed and kicked dowm. i dont know who to trust, i dont know if im even loved anymore or cared for. on top of that i am getting verbally assaulted and hurt daily until i am literally crying myself to sleep, i have fallen on the ground in tears from these assaults, it hurts me so much.... then on top of my assaults i keep getting thrown at me, i am constantly reminded of how much of a failure i am. i found the love of my life, someone i loved with every ounce of my heart, then they turned around and ripped my heart out leaving me bleeding on the floor. i offered my love back to them, and they threw it away like trash, they threw it away like they threw me away, i just get used until im worthless to everyone then im forgotten and abandoned to just lay there on the floor, bleeding from what they did to me. i will never find someone i loved as much as them,it is impossible to, me a useless pile of garbage me, i remain unloved for all eternity, no one will care about me or love me because all i am is a failure and a worthless pile of trash. all im good for is being people's emotional playground. makeing me feel joy then right after stabbing me and breaking me down until im a worthless worm, i just want to die, and i really am thinking of hanging myself later this week.
