		<p>Hi, welcome to my portfolio! this page is a short little biography about me!</p<>
                      <br><p>I was born On October 18th in Jacksonville Florida, as I grew up I gained a great appreciation for nature and for the underwater worlds of oceans and rivers and lakes.</p>
			    <p>After I started to gain a great apreciation for those things i started to keep a couple of fish, which over time has grown to a great collection of exotics from around the world with over one hundred and forty fish!</p>
                        <br><p> Later on in my life I started to invest my time into learning to computer program. I wanted to learn how to make a video game that could be sold on steam but I did not know how to program and I did not have enough money to afford classes, and so I sat down and taught myself, non stop for 4 years of my life I sat down and taught myself how to programs, I sat down in the physics engine known as Unreal Engine 4 and i worked there non stop until I was able to program in the language called C++. I started to use this knowledge to start creating a mod for the game ARK Survival Evolved, and as of now this mod has a 4 star rating on Steam!</p>
			<br><p> I have still not created a working videogame to be sold for profit but i have many unfinished projects that i am working on! One of which was an idea though of during a quarentine for Covid-19, It is a fully interactive photo realistic Virtual Reality world designed strictly for those who are home bound because of medical conditions, the elderly, the higher risk group of people, people on the Autism Spectrum and so forth! It has even been used to help relive stress upon the people who have tested the closed pre alpha build! My goal is to eventually complete this project with more funding so I could be able to sell this project to help
			    benifit as many people as I possibly can!</p>
