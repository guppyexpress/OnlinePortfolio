	    <title>Nebo's horrible life</title>
	    <h1> Nebo's suffering life </h1>
		    <p>i am sitting here swamped in work barely able to breathe yet im still trying to swim, im constantly hurting, getting stabbed in my heart every single day, unloved by anyone and hated by all
		    i have never done anything good, i dont deserve to live, im a useless failure, i cant go one day in my life without getting yelled at and harmed, it is almost like
		    no one cares about my personality. no one cares about my looks, no one cares about my health, no one cares about me,  everything is my fault i cant do anything right im just a useless failure
		    why would anyone want to care about a useless failure waste of time such as me? i cant do anything right and i dont deserve to live.... i have nn tallent no skill, i am just a waste of time on this horrid planet, theres no more 
		    motivation to live, im tired of this pain,  im tired of sitting here suffering, there is a great desire for the sweet relief of death from this endless pain.
		    what happened? well let me start this story for you.............
		    
		    to start off this horrid life story i was born a middle child, meaning i dont get too much in life, kinda just thrown away and left alone my whole life growing up, so i already had it rough enough, later on in life my mother gained auto immune disorders making it so that she almost died, that hurt me a lot but i got used to things like that so it quickly was ignored.
		    then about 4 years ago thats when things started to go down hill, very very very fast.... i fell down and got a concussion, it wasnt too bad i ended up blacking out and going to the ER but, there was the belief that it caused no harm, but since then thing have been different......
		    ever since that point i have a twitch, and ive been mocked and riduculed for it, its not like a small twitch, my entire body will shake which always causes people to stop and glare at me, and even laughing at me for it.
		    to get ontop of that, every once and a while a couple times through the year, i get vertigo so badly i cant stand up, it prevents me from physically moving, and its not like i feel dizzy, instead my entire vision starts spinning and it makes me sick, yet everyone has always decided to blow it off and say "im faking it" even thought its v ery serious and important.
		    and finally to add to my pain of that, i am mildly schitzofrenic, not like i constantly see people or things, but like, randomly every couple of months i get to have one of these attacks, and it is so completely terifying i physically cant do anything but curl up into a corner shake back and forth and cry, and these attacks are not short, they will last for 8 or more hours, causing me to suffer and hurt and ive always been told
		    "your making it up" "your not actually hurting like that" but in reality im under so much pain from it i physically cant do anything theres no cure for this, im forced to sit here and suffer for eternity or die....
		    by this point in my life hospital visits were a common site, my father had cancer, my mother had a brain tumor, my sister had a heart attack and im just sitting here watching all this pain and suffering in my life unable to do ANYTHING it caused so much pain i swore to myself, i will do everything in my power to make other people have a great life, even at the cost of my own, as long as others are happy i will sit there and hurt and  suffer....
		    none of this past history helped with my relationship status aswell..... every single time it doesnt even last 2 months, why? its because im a failure, its my fault always, i have been in relationships where i got abused, not physically, but mentally, forcing me into anxiety attacks and causing me to fear relationships, and so, i took a break, i took a 4 month break, i was still hurting but went ehh why not ill try again,
		    bad mistake, it was perfect it was the person of my dreams! but suddenly out of no where, i got stabbed in the back, they broke all promises with me, and shattered my hopes and dreams, before i got with them i was horribly depressed and i even tried to kill myself 3 different times, once i got with them i was the happiest person alive! then i got my heart ripped out of me by them, it broke me down, to the point of i physically cant recover,
		    when they ripped out my heart, they stole with them my will to live, and it was like a massive spike stabbed through me causing me to endlessly hurt, and daily they come back and make sure to brag on how they ripped out my heart and it is causing me to get lower and lower in my pit of suffering, its horrible, it hurts so much, 
		    i hate how im constantly laughed at and hurt, im tired of being the person who everyonde pretends to be friends with, then turns around and once im gone, talk about how they only put up with me because they feel bad, friends are supposed to be there for you, not pretend in order to use you for your talents, your skills, your money, 
		    at this point its hard to tell who is an actual friend and who is there just to stab me when they get the chance. i cant even trust anyone anymore.....
		    I can never do anything right, i am always a failure, a waste of time, no one should ever care about me, i dont provide anything, im not cool, im just a useless computer nerd who will just for eternity be alone and hurting because no one would care about a computer nerd such as me.
		    why care about someone who cant do anything cool physically, all i can do is make dang wesbites and broken games, nothing i make is useful, nothing i can do is cool or special, its just there, i am just "there" i cant do anything in life and wont get anywhere, i will just sit here alone and hurting without anything, without anyone who cares because no one cares about a nerd, no one cares about a computer person, no one cares about a useless person like me
		    there is nothing i can do to help anyone, no matter how much i try, i will always fail at everything i ever do, i will always fail at all things i try to do, im just useless and deserve nothing but pain and to die alone in a hole,
		    
		    at this point, what is the purpose in life? theres nothing left for me, all of my hopes and dreams, all of my motivation to live, all gone, all crushed, all thrown away by how much pain im going through, it hurts, it doesnt hurt on the outside, but on the inside, where scars dont heal, where wounds never heal, just on the  inside where i am forced to sit there with an eternally broken heart with no purpose in life but to sit here and suffer and to be useless,
		    i did have a will to live at some point, i used to have one, then through the times and getting hurt over and over again endlessly, i just lost it, my will to live is no more, i have nothing keeping me alive anymore, i have no motivation to stay alive, every day im longing for death so that all my pain will be gone. im tired of being stuck in this endless loop of pain, every waking hour adds more and more to my internal heartbreak, its just ripping me apart and i have no motivation to live because of it
		    i am already mentally unstable enough, i am already hurting enough, but when i wake up and get attacked every morning, when i wake up and get hurt every day, it just brings me down into wanting death even sooner, and i really dont want to die, i want all my pain, and suffering to die and the things causing it to go away.... but in order to do that, i myself also have to die.
		    dont you love it when your way of going through the work and going through life is constantly hated on and constantly rediculed for everything that you do? cuz i sure do! just constantly being ridiculed for my working patterns and how i design things, i just want a day without pain like this.....
			    
			i like how i gave him the world, i would have done anything for him, i would have bought anything for him, givin him anything, he was always my first line of attention, never leaving his side, always there to respond when he needed it.... but no, even after i gave him the world, gave him my heart and sould, he tore it away from me, hurt me, and stabbed me in the back; he didnt just hurt me, but he left me there
			    alone
			    empty
			    hurtting
			    he left me alone to die, with no reason to live anymore, he was my reason to wake up everymorning, see his face every day, i just wanted to be loved in life i wanted to be appreciated and cared for, is that too much to ask for? no no its not, but why did he stab me like this? i just wanted to be cared for and loved, that really isnt too much to ask for, but apparently it is, its too much to just ask to be loved in life. i just want to go through my life knowing im wanted, but so far all ive seen is pain
			    
			    
		    but here i am, this is my story, i hope you enjoy.
